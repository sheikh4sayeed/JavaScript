//Varibale means it can be canagable value
var name ="Sheikh Sayeed"
var age =23;
console.log(name + "is a good boy");
console.log("His age is " + age);
//Here we store data 23 and Sheikh Sayeed into two different variable name and age
/*
Here is a magic and it is.if we declear variable after console the data it gives us undifined because of JavaScript copile line by line. 
for example
*/
console.log("My latop price is " + price);//out will be undefined because firsty run console.log then declear variable that's why price is undefined
var price=38000;

//before use the variable we must be declear otherwise we got undefined value.
